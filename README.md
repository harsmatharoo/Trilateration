Using MATLAB, this program tends to use distinct methods to calculate the distance from a specific moving object in 3D space to 8 beacons located at different points in the same 3D space. Morever, calculations are done to estimate the XYZ co-ordinates of the object at a given time using the well-known nonlinear least square method.
